## Steps to run locally:

1) install the dependencies : npm install
2) run the start script: npm run start

( developed using node v10.14.2/npm v 6.4.1)

## Assumptions:
1) Built for mobile only because the screenshot was mobile only. Will work for bigger screens but with the mobile layout.
2) Used components as functions where possible as supported by the latest react framework
3) I assumed that the gray space below the thrid menu item ("Amenities") was also another menu item and not empty space. Since I was not sure what the option would have been, I only built 3 for the task.
4) I also assumed that the menu options would be symmetrical in design, i.e. the last option would also have rounded bottom edges just like the top one.
5) The background color of the logo provided was not the same as the background color of the header. So I cropped out the logo from the test image provided.
6) Picked the colors using paint-3D, so I get as close to the desing as possible.
7) Tests not added based on the description that this assesment is to gauge design detail, semantic html and CSS/responsive design.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
